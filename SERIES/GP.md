# Geomatric Progression (GP)

> General Pattern  
> a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, . . ., ar<sup>n-1</sup>, ar<sup>n</sup>

> First Terms - a

> Common ratio - r

```
T1/T2 = r
T2/T3 = r
.
.
Tn-1/Tn = r
```

> General Terms  
> **T<sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>n-1</sup>**

## Sum of n terms

> ```
>     (a - r^n)
> S = -----------
>       r - 1
> ```

```
S = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + . . . + ar^n-2 + ar^n-1

-Sr = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + . . . + ar^n-1 + ar^n

S(1-r) =  a - ar^n

S = (a - ar^n) / 1-r
```

## Sum of infinite terms when r < 1

> ```
>         a
> S = -----------
>       r - 1
>
> r^n---------> infinity
> ```

## Properties of GP

> a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, . . ., ar<sup>n-1</sup>, ar<sup>n</sup>

```
1. if a, b , c are in GP then

b/a = c/b

+----------+
| b^2 = ac |
+----------+
```

### Geomatric Mean (GM)

```
2. a1, a2, a3, a4,...., an are in GP then their

GM = (a1 x a2 x a3 x...xan)^(1/n)

For two numbers in GP say a and b then
GM = âˆšab
```

```
3. Every number is Geomatric mean of num at equal distance from it.
a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8,
|   |   |       |   |   |
|   |   |       |   |   |
|   |   |_______|   |   |
|   |               |   |
|   |_______________|   |
|                       |
|_______________________|
```

```
4.In Gp Product of term from front and end at equal distant are same
T1 x Tn = T2 x Tn-1 = T3 x Tn-2

```
